Dynamic Full-Stack Portfolio Website

This is a comprehensive, dynamic personal portfolio built from the ground up to showcase full-stack web development skills using core Java technologies. The site is fully manageable from a custom-built, secure admin panel.
This project was developed as a human-AI collaboration to demonstrate a modern, tool-assisted development workflow, where I acted as the lead architect directing the implementation.



üöÄ Key Features
